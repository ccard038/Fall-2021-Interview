## Run Instructions

To run the app change directory to backend and run app.js (node app.js).
Unit tests and Integration Tests can be ran with npm test.
Testing the API can be done Postman / SOAPUI.

## Additional Information

Database is mostly set up, I couldn't get saving to work correctly with mongoose so I'm missing a working implementation.
